# Layer 2 Solutions

Layer 2 protocols take advantage of Ethereumâ€™s decentralized security model while negating its scalability constraints by adding another layer of transactions on top of it [\[4\]](../references.md#4-paul-wackerow-dave-sam-richards-and-debali.-layer-2-rollups.-https-ethereum.org-en-developers-docs). Unlike layer 1 solutions, layer 2 solutions do not make any changes to the underlying network and are instead implemented as smart contracts on top of the layer 1 network. There are mainly three ways in which layer 2 scaling solutions are exercised - (a) State Channels, (b) Plasma, or (c) Rollups.
