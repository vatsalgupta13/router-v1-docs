# Rollups

Rollup is another popular layer 2 scaling technique that has gained much traction in recent years through its promise of higher transaction throughput, reduced fees, and open participation [\[4\]](../references.md#4-paul-wackerow-dave-sam-richards-and-debali.-layer-2-rollups.-https-ethereum.org-en-developers-docs). Rollups differ from state channels and plasma in that they do not move transactional data off-chain; instead, they only seek to transfer the computation off the Ethereum mainchain. By keeping the majority of transaction data on-chain, rollups make a trade-off between scalability and security. The data bandwidth of the base chain limits scalability (albeit in a more amenable ratio since rollups replace data with computation wherever possible) [\[9\]](../references.md#9-vitalik-buterin.-an-incomplete-guide-to-rollups.-https-vitalik.ca-general-2021-01-05-rollup.html-j). Security, on the other hand, is enhanced as compared to the other approaches since rollups inherit the security properties of the base chain itself.
