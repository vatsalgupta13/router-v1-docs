# Compatibility with Non-EVM Chains

Compatibility with non-EVM blockchains is a critical piece of the puzzle that is blockchain interoperability. Non-EVM blockchains like Solana, Algorand, and Terra have their own runtime environments, and connecting them to EVM-based chains requires significant effort. We have already started working on developing a bridge contract on the CosmWasm module, which will allow us to plug into the Terra ecosystem. Moving forward, we also intend to incorporate other non-EVM chains into Router's super-mesh.
