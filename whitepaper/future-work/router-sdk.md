# Router SDK

Cross-chain liquidity migration is only one of the numerous applications that Router Protocol can facilitate. As previously stated, Router can allow the transfer of any contract-level data across multiple chains. This opens the door to a variety of operations around Router, including but not limited to cross-chain lending, cross-chain multi-sig wallet, and cross-chain limit orders. We will launch a dedicated Router SDK for enabling the DeFi community to leverage our technology to build more cross-chain applications, thereby promoting blockchain interoperability. With the SDK, developers will no longer need to deploy separate contracts to enable cross-chain messaging across various chains. Router SDK will fulfill that requirement for them.
