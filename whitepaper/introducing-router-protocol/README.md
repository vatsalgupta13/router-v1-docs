# Introducing Router Protocol

Until now, we have discussed a fundamental problem plaguing the DeFi ecosystem and how existing solutions, although having made significant strides towards cross-chain liquidity migration, suffer from critical issues that impede their usability. To this end, we introduce Router Protocol, an extensible multi-directional bridge that connects current and emerging layer 1 and layer 2 blockchains to allow contract-level data flow across them. This could be a token that is locked on the source chain and redeemed on the target chain or an operation that is initiated on the source chain and executed on the target chain.
