# Redeem R-Asset for Asset

This guide will delineate all the steps required to claim the original asset using its wrapped version.

**Step 1)** Go to the "Manage Liquidity" section on Router's mainnet. You can find that section [here](https://app.routerprotocol.com/manageliquidity).

**Step 2)** Make sure you are on the correct blockchain network. If not, switch to the network on which you have the R-Asset. In this guide, we will demonstrate how to claim MATIC using RMATIC on Polygon.

{% hint style="info" %}
As mentioned [here](../more-about-router-protocol/r-assets.md#does-router-protocol-create-a-wrapped-version-of-all-tokens), there are three kinds of R-Asset you can receive - RUSDC, RMATIC, or RBNB.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Step 3)** Click on the "Withdraw" button next to the asset you want to claim, in this case, MATIC.
