# Bug Bounty Program

Audits alone are not sufficient for DeFi protocols. As the countless exploits and hacks have made obvious, even audited projects can suffer from attacks and lose funds. By engaging in a bug bounty program with [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/) â€” one of the leading teams of testing and securing Web 3.0 protocols in the world, we are not only engaging a single auditing firm but rather an entire community of whitehat hackers, all competing for the top prize of $200k.&#x20;
