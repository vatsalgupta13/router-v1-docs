# Audits

We have completed security audits from [Certik](https://www.certik.com/), [Halborn](https://halborn.com/), and [Hacken](https://hacken.io/). Since the security of cross-chain projects has been under scrutiny as a result of recent hacks, we decided that it was prudent to get multiple audits to cover all our bases.&#x20;
