# Token Utility

### **Governance**

The holders of the $ROUTE token will be able to use their tokens to take part in Router's governance by voting on Router's proposals concerning protocol amendments and upgrades.

### **Revenue Sharing**

Router Protocol will impose a small cross-chain transaction fee which will be distributed among the validators and liquidity providers.&#x20;

### **Concession on Transaction Fees**

Users willing to pay Router's cross-chain transaction fee in $ROUTE tokens will receive a 50% concession. If the fee for a particular transaction is $4 when paid in stables or the source chain's native gas token, users need to pay just $2 in $ROUTE tokens.

### **CrossTalk Fees**

ROUTE token will be used as a fee token in Routerâ€™s CrossTalk library.

### **Unified Gas and Transaction Fees**

Router Protocol will simplify the process of paying gas fees for cross-chain transactions by enabling users to pay a combined (gas + transaction) fee in $ROUTE tokens. It is important to note that, although the users will be incentivized to pay their fees in $ROUTE tokens, the users can also choose to pay the fees in the gas token native to the source chain.
